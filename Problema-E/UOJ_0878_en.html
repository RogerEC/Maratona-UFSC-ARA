		<div class="problem">

			<div class="description">
				<p>During the student strike, Tobias participated in various activities, organized programming workshops and even hosted an edition of the Programming Marathon here at UFSC Campus Araranguá. To do all this, he had to stop attending several classes, failing to take tests and assignments.</p>

<p>The very understanding teachers agreed to reschedule the activities to be delivered after the strike ended, but many of them ended up rescheduling the activities at the same time, generating several conflicts. For example, if a teacher has scheduled a test for 7 am and the test will last 2 hours, until 9 pm Tobias will not be able to perform any other scheduled activity.</p>

<p>Realizing that his schedule was full of conflict and that all activities might not be possible, Tobias asked for his help in finding out as many activities as he could do without overlapping.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Input</h2>

			<div class="input">
				<p>The first line contains an integer <strong>N</strong> (1 ≤ <strong>N</strong> ≤ 100,000) that indicates how many rescheduled activities Tobias has noted in his calendar. In the next N lines there will be two integers <strong>H</strong> and <strong>D</strong> (1&nbsp;≤ <strong>H</strong>, <strong>D</strong> ≤ 1,000,000) separated by a space, indicating the start time of the activity and its duration.</p>

<p>In this problem, consider that our super Tobias has already mastered the art of teleportation, so he can start an activity at the exact moment that the previous activity has ended, and as it is a bit disorganized, so don't expect to find any order in your calendar notes. .</p>

			<h2>Output</h2>

			<div class="output">
				<p>Print a single line containing an integer, the maximum number of activities Tobias will be able to do without overlapping.</p>
