		<div class="problem">

			<div class="description">
				<p>In order to stop the general student strike, the government held a meeting with the UFSC. During the meeting, UFSC explained all the expenses needed to keep it running until the end of the year, and the Government reported amounts it could offer to cover these expenses. The meeting was not very organized, and several individual values were mentioned, so no one knows if the amounts offered are sufficient to cover all university expenses.</p>

<p>Given the list of values cited at the meeting, your task will be to sum the expenses and funds offered to inform UFSC students whether the strike should stop or not.</p>
			</div>
			<h2>Input</h2>

			<div class="input">
				<p>The entry starts with an integer <strong>N</strong> (1&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\leq\) <strong>N</strong> <span class="math-tex">\(\leq\) 100,000) that indicates the number of values cited in the meeting. Each line has a T character and an integer <strong>C</strong> (1 <span class="math-tex">\(\leq\) <strong>C</strong> <span class="math-tex">\(\leq\) 100,000) separated by a blank space. T will be equal to 'V'&nbsp;if value <strong>C</strong> represents a government grant, or equal to 'G'&nbsp;if value <strong>C</strong> represents a university expense.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Output</h2>

			<div class="output">
				<p>Print out <strong>“The strike will stop.”</strong> If government figures are enough to cover all university spending by the end of the year, or print <strong>“NO CUT, FIGHT!”</strong> Otherwise. (In both cases the sentence must be printed without quotation marks).</p>
